- Tool/model & version: Gemini
- What I asked for: I asked for Gemini to help me translate the RNA code to a protein sequence from the Rosalind input.
- Snippet of prompt(s): "Please remove the 3 codon error from the translation"
- What I changed before committing: I changed the function utilized to len to set up a code where it would only provide a final sequence and cut off at the last multiple of 3 to ensure no errors in the code.
- How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): I verified this code by using the practice sequence provided by Rosalind, and when it worked, I switched over to formally attempting the problem.
